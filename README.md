#Evaluating the Efficacy of Magnetometer Based Parking Sensors 


#### Experiment 1: Evaluating the Stability of Current Market Magnetometer Chips
This experiment entailed building, assembling, and testing the "drift" or variance of three different magnetometer chips
over a three week time period in a controlled environment. See Arduino Folder: "Drift_Experiment" 
for the sketches that communicate with a web server to post the magnetometer data over WiFi communication.
